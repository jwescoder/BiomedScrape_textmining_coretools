# BiomedScrape_textmining_coretools
Principal Python code blocks in the BiomedScrape suite of bioinformatic tools developed to allow for efficient, modular comparison of similarity across distinct sets of topic-focused documents (biomedical-related in this case). Modules such as gensim and scikit-learn greatly facilitate this process, but practical implementation of code is still quite difficult due to simultaneous need to successfully implement interfaces with document database API's (such as the National Library of Medicine's eutils API in this case), careful tokenizing of the query and test document sets (e.g. abstracts pertaining to a specific disease and abstracts pertaining to a series of drugs for therapy, respectively), choosing and handling the right delimiter for isolating exclusively the desired text (e.g. Pubmed abstracts), tricky and error-prone string editing steps, correctly vectorizing the tokenized documents, and correctly training the LSA model from e.g. gensim (in this case using neutral pertinent document corpora scraped chronologically from the NLM database -- explained separately in the CorpusOptima-related repositories). The code samples provided here were tailored to specific projects for my NIH biomedical fellowship, but are modular and can be easily adapted for any complex document comparison undertaking in any field.
